# OXO Scan Orchestration Engine

OXO is a security scanning framework built for modularity, scalability, and simplicity.

OXO Engine combines specialized tools to work cohesively to find vulnerabilities and perform actions like recon, enumeration, and fingerprinting...

# Requirements

Docker is required to run scans locally. To install Docker, please follow these
[instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

# Installing

OXO ships as a Python package on PyPI. To install it, simply run the following command if you have `pip` already
installed.

```shell
pip install -U ostorlab
```

# Getting Started

OXO ships with a store that boasts dozens of agents, from network scanning agents like Nmap, Nuclei, or
Tsunami,
web scanners like ZAP, web fingerprinting tools like WhatWeb and Wappalyzer, DNS brute-forcing like Subfinder and DNSX,
malware file scanning like VirusTotal and much more.

To run any of these tools combined, simply run the following command:

> OXO CLI is accessible using the `oxo` command.

```shell
oxo scan run --install --agent nmap --agent tsunami --agent nuclei ip 8.8.8.8
```

or 

```shell
oxo scan run --install --agent agent/ostorlab/nmap --agent agent/ostorlab/tsunami --agent agent/ostorlab/nuclei ip 8.8.8.8
```


This command will download and install the following scanning agents:

* [agent/ostorlab/nmap](https://oxo.ostorlab.co/store/agent/ostorlab/nmap)
* [agent/ostorlab/tsunami](https://oxo.ostorlab.co/store/agent/ostorlab/tsunami)
* [agent/ostorlab/nuclei](https://oxo.ostorlab.co/store/agent/ostorlab/nuclei)

And will scan the target IP address `8.8.8.8`.

Agents are shipped as standard Docker images.

To check the scan status, run:

```shell
oxo scan list
```

Once the scan has completed, you can access the results by running:

```shell
oxo vulnz list --scan-id <scan-id>
oxo vulnz describe --vuln-id <vuln-id>
```

# Docker Image 
To run `oxo` in a container, you can use the publicly available image and run the following command:  

```shell
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ostorlab/oxo:latest scan run --install --agent nmap --agent nuclei --agent tsunami ip 8.8.8.8
```

Notes:
* The command starts directly with `scan run` because the `ostorlab/oxo` image has `oxo` as its `entrypoint`.
* It is important to mount the Docker socket so `oxo` can create agents on the host machine.

# Assets

OXO supports scanning of multiple asset types, below is the list of currently supported:

| Asset       | Description                                                                        |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| agent       | Run a scan for an agent. This is used for agents scanning themselves (meta-scanning). |
| ip          | Run a scan for an IP address or an IP range.                                      |
| link        | Run a scan for a web link, accepting a URL, method, headers, and request body.      |
| file        | Run a scan for a generic file.                                                     |
| android-aab | Run a scan for an Android .AAB package file.                                       |
| android-apk | Run a scan for an Android .APK package file.                                       |
| ios-ipa     | Run a scan for an iOS .IPA file.                                                   |
| domain-name | Run a scan for a domain name asset by specifying the protocol or port.              |

# The Store

OXO lists all agents on a public store where you can search and also publish your own agents.

![Store](images/store-preview.gif)

# Publish your first agent

To write your first agent, check out the full tutorial [here](https://oxo.ostorlab.co/tutorials/write_an_agent).

The steps are basically as follows:

* Clone a template agent with all files already set up.
* Modify the `template_agent.py` file to add your logic.
* Update the `Dockerfile` to add any extra build steps.
* Edit the `ostorlab.yaml` file to include selectors, documentation, the image name, and the license.
* Publish on the store.
* Profit!

Once you have written your agent, you can publish it on the store for others to discover and use. The store handles agent building and automatically picks up new releases from your Git repository.

## Ideas for agents to build

Implementation of popular tools like:

* ~~[Semgrep](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep) for source code scanning.~~
* [NBTscan](http://www.unixwiz.net/tools/nbtscan.html): Scans for open NetBIOS nameservers on your target’s network.
* [onesixtyone](https://github.com/trailofbits/onesixtyone): Fast scanner to find publicly exposed SNMP services.
* [Retire.js](http://retirejs.github.io/retire.js/): Scanner detecting the use of JavaScript libraries with known
  vulnerabilities.
* ~~[Snallygaster](https://github.com/hannob/snallygaster): Finds file leaks and other security problems on HTTP servers.~~
* [testssl.sh](https://testssl.sh/): Identifies various TLS/SSL weaknesses, including Heartbleed, CRIME, and ROBOT.
* ~~[TruffleHog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog): Searches through Git repositories for high-entropy strings and secrets, digging deep into commit history.~~
* [cve-bin-tool](https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool): Scans binaries for vulnerable components.
